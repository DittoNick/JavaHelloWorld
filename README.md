### Extended Hello world, written in JAVA with Maven ###


#### Preamble ####

This project is intended for my learning purposes, feel free to copy, download
or fork.

It is first project written in __Java(JDK 11)__ without former experience
with Java language.

The __HelloWorld app is extended by Greeter class__ which only consists of
greet methods.

I wrote tests for Greeter class to understand how testing works with
JUnit4 even I know JUnit5 is out.

I will be continue with development of this simple application by creating
some UI displaying greet message from input box written in swing, javafx or qt.
